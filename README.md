# Titanic Kaggle

## Description

This project aims to determine who would have survived the Titanic disaster by utilizing various machine learning techniques, including MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)

## Dataset

Data retrieved from Kaggle, accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).


## Technologies Used

The analyses were conducted using the following technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

Refer to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/guievbs/titanic-kaggle/blob/main/requirements.txt) to view all the required libraries and their versions

## Machine learn Algorithms

Various machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate their accuracy. Each algorithm was tested in its default mode and after tuning its parameters for optimization

## Competitions 

Since this dataset is for competitions, I made two submissions to see the scores of my models:

    1. Score: 0.744
    2. Score: 0.765
